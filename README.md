<h1>Use Linux commands to manage file permissions</h1>

<h2>Project description</h2>

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

<h3>Check file and directory details</h3>

To check permissions set for files and subdirectories in the projects directory including hidden files, the command I would use inside that directory is: **ls -la** 
<br/><br/>
“ls” to list files and subdirectories with added option “-l” to check permissions and “-a” to include hidden files.
